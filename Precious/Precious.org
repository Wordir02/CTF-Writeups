as always the first step is to ping the target's IP address to actually verify that it is reachable.
so we are going to use nmap to ping it.

#+begin_bash bash
nmap -sn 10.10.11.189
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-03-25 16:52 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.189
Host is up (0.051s latency).
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.05 seconds
#+end_bash


OK it would appear that the host is active, now it's time to run a scan with nmap to see which ports are open:


#+begin_bash bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV -O 10.10.11.189

as you can see we have port 22(ssh) and port 80(http) open,
since to log in with *ssh* we need a username and password,for the moment we will take a look at the website.

inserting the IP address into our browser a domain is returned, which however the public DNS is unable to resolve, it will therefore be
you need to add the IP address and domain name to *"etc/hosts"*

#+begin_bash bash
sudo vim /etc/hosts

and paste this:

10.10.11.189    precious.htb

#+end_bash

this is what is returned to us:
